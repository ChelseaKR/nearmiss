"""Normalize a freshly extracted ``messages.pot`` into its committed form.

`pybabel extract` writes a few tokens that are volatile across machines, dates,
and Babel patch releases (the POT creation timestamp, the Babel version in
``Generated-By``, and the current year in the boilerplate comment block). It also
tags any string containing a literal ``%`` — e.g. ``95%`` or ``{pct}%`` — as
``python-format`` (printf style) *in addition to* ``python-brace-format``. That
is a false positive here: nearmiss's messages are rendered with ``str.format``,
never ``%``-formatting, so ``msgfmt --check-format`` would wrongly reject the
literal percent signs. We drop the spurious ``python-format`` flag.

This runs both when the catalog is authored and inside the ``make i18n`` gate
(``pybabel extract`` → normalize → ``git diff --exit-code``), so the committed
template stays byte-stable and "POT is current" is a meaningful, non-flaky check.
