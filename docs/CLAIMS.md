# Claims manifest

Every load-bearing accuracy claim in the prose docs is wrapped in a paired HTML comment
(`<!-- claim:ID --> … <!-- /claim:ID -->`) and listed here with a **witness**: the test or source
file that makes the claim true (or, for a "planned, not yet implemented" claim, the file whose
*absence of* the feature the wording honestly describes).

`tools/check_claims.py` (run by `make claims`, part of `make verify`) enforces the manifest in both
directions:

- every claim ID below appears as a **matched** open/close tag pair in its doc file;
- every witness path exists, and a `path::test_name` witness names a function that exists;
- every `<!-- claim:… -->` tag found in `README.md`, `docs/METHODOLOGY.md`, or `CHANGELOG.md` is
  listed here — a tagged claim missing from this table fails the gate (drift is caught both ways).

The witness is deliberately narrow: it is the thing a reviewer can open to confirm the sentence is
not an overclaim. When a claim says a feature is *planned*, the witness is the file that would house
it, so the gap stays visible instead of drifting back into a promise.
